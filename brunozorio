Hi. I'm Bruno ZÃ³rio and this is my UX/UI Case Study:
https://www.behance.net/gallery/94758397/E-commerce-website-UXUI-Case-Study

It's organized following the UX processes: discover > define > ideate > design > prototype > testing

Regarding your specific questions, here are the answers:

* What was the problem?
Create a e-commerce website for a bicycle manufacturer.

* What research did you conduct? How did you make decisions?
I did a competitive analysis highlighting the main points informed by the persona created.
These informations was essential for the definition of the project.

* Did you use a styleguide? If so, who created it?
Yes, I did. I created the styleguide myself.

* How did you solve that problem?
The persona's main point was the option of personalization and unique identity in his lifestyle.
This point was not seen in the competitors. The solution was to offer the standard bicycles to customers in general and
offer the option of customization to the most demanding customers.

* How did you collaborate with teammates (PMs, engineers, stakeholders, designers)?
I carried out the entire project on my own.
The only collaboration I had was in the usability tests that I applied and sent to 10 people for analysis.

* How did you measure its success?
In the applied tests, the comment I received was that both the navigation and the layout were very clean and straightforward,
that the customization option really met the interests of the persona and that e-commerce would be a website that they would be
interested in navigating to buy a bicycle.

* What do you know now that you wish you knew when you started? How the project would change?
The only change it would make would be to start the mobile version before the desktop version.
The mobile version is currently in progress.
