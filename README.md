# Origin Product Design Take-Home Assignment

Financial wellness is not just about getting rid of problems like credit cards or student debt. It is also – and arguably mainly – about fulfilling your dreams. 

Some of us want to buy a car. Some of us want to take a vacation. Some of us want to have a baby. Every single one of us wants something.

That is especially true given Origin's persona, an upper-middle-class 32-year-old designer who lives in San Francisco (or, more precisely, in their phone) and works for a venture-backed tech startup. This person makes enough money to save and live comfortably but wants to better understand where their money is going and how to more effectively save for their future.

Origin wants to help them plan for their future by helping them understand how to better save money and where to allocate these savings. 

We’ve been working relentlessly to deliver a solid product that will empower people on those goals and we are measuring that by looking closely at three metrics:
* Percent of users that finish the onboarding process
* Percent of users who are following at least one of our recommendation
* Percent of users who are engaging with the platform at least once per month

As our designer, we want you to access our platform and bring three design hypothesis that you think will help Origin provide an even better financial health platform.

How would you prioritize it? How would you plan each initiative?

Please use our [style guide](https://www.figma.com/file/i6U64YdCWEbbT0J8jyFBq0/Style-Guide?node-id=2%3A3) when designing your proposal. We are customer-centric and are obsessed with details, so deliver your best possible work. We also value intellectual rigor, so feel free to create new components or add functionality not described above.

We run a very collaborative process, so feel free to get in touch with us to ask questions, get feedback, or anything else we can help with (really).
You can deliver the prototype through any platform that you are familiar with – Invision, Marvel, Figma, anything that works –, as long as the final product is in English. If you'd like to document your process, we'd love to see wireframes, research, interviews, everything. Honestly, go for it!
