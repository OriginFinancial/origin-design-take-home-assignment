# Origin Product Design Take-Home Assignment

Financial wellness is not just about getting rid of problems like credit card or student debt. It is also – and arguably mainly – about fulfilling your dreams. Some of us want to buy a car. Some of us want to take a vacation. Some of us want to have a baby. Every single one of us wants something.

That is especially true given Origin's persona, an upper-middle class 32 year old designer who lives in San Francisco (or, more precisely, in their phone) and works for a venture-backed tech startup. This person makes enough money to save and live comfortably, but wants to start planning more seriously for their short and long-term goals.

Origin wants to help them reach their savings goals by making monthly deposits towards their objectives. As our designer, you will design a high-fidelity interface prototype that allows (at least) our users to:

1. Specify the goals that they want to save toward and the time to reach these goals (e.g. Save for April 2022 Wedding)
2. Specify the priority of these goals
3. View a recommendation for the amount that they should be contributing to each goal each month and specify the monthly contribution
4. View and track progress towards these goals

Please use our [style guide](https://github.com/OriginFinancial/origin-design-take-home-assignment/blob/master/Style%20Guide.sketch) when designing your solution. We are customer centric and are obsessed with details, so deliver your best possible work. We also value intellectual rigor, so feel free to create new components or add functionality not described above.

We run a very collaborative process, so feel free to get in touch with us to ask questions, get feedback or anything else we can help with (really).

You can deliver the high-fidelity prototype through any platform that you are familiar with – Invision, Marvel, Figma, anything that works –, as long as the final product is in English. If you'd like to document your process, we'd love to see wireframes, research, interviews, everything. Honestly, go for it!
