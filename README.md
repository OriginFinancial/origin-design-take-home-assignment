# Origin Product Design Take-Home Assignment

Financial wellness is not just about getting rid of problems like credit card or student debt. It is also – and arguably mainly – about fulfilling your dreams. Some of us want to buy a car. Some of us want to take a vacation. Some of us want to have a baby. Every single one of us want something.

That is especially true given Origin's persona, an upper-middle class 32 year old designer who lives in San Francisco (or, more precisely, in their phone) and works for a venture-backed tech startup. This person makes enough money to make ends meet, keep their debt in check and also enjoy the best that life can offer if they start saving consciously.

Origin wants to help them reach their savings goals by making monthly deposits towards their objectives. As our designer, you will design a high-fidelity interface prototype that allows (at least) our users to:

1. See the savings goals they have created, with the amount they still need to save and how much time left before they accomplish the goal.
2. Create a new savings goal.
3. Define the savings goals attributes – its name, the amount they want to save for it and the number of months until they'd like to have the total amount available for their usage – and save it.

We value technical excellence, so we expect you to use our [style guide](https://github.com/OriginFinancial/origin-design-take-home-assignment/blob/master/Style%20Guide.sketch). We are customer centric and are obsessed with details, so deliver your best possible work. We also value intellectual rigor, so feel free to create new components or add functionality not described above.

We run a very collaborative process, so feel free to get in touch with us to ask questions, get feedback or anything else we can help with (really).

You can deliver the high-fidelity prototype through any platform that you are familiar with – Invision, Marvel, Figma, anything that works –, as long as the final product is in English. If you'd like to document your process, we'd love to see wireframes, research, interviews, everything. Honestly, go for it!
