# Origin Product Design Take-Home Assignment

Financial wellness is not just about getting rid of problems like credit card or student debt. It is also – and arguably mainly – about having confidence in the decisions you're making today and planning for your future so you can reach your goals. 

That is especially true for Origin's persona, an upper-middle-class 32-year-old designer who lives in San Francisco and works for a venture-backed tech startup. This person makes enough money to save and live comfortably but doesn't have a great way of managing her finances or planning out her financial future. She wants to have more certainty about the decisions she's making today and receive guidance on how she can best prepare for a sound financial future.

Origin wants to help our users by being the single destination where they manage both their day-to-day finances as well as where they plan out their long-term financial roadmap. 

We’ve been working relentlessly to deliver a solid product that will empower people to make better financial decisions and feel more confident about their financial future. The primary metrics that we use to measure our success are:
* Percent of users who are acting on at least one of our financial recommendations
* Percent of users who are engaging with the platform at least once per month
* Percent of users who self-report that their overall financial wellness has increased since they started using Origin

As our designer, we want you to access our platform and develop three hypotheses that you think will help Origin optimize the metrics presented above. Please explain how you developed these hypotheses. You can sign up for a test account [here](https://app-development.useorigin.com/sign-up). Please don't add any of your sensitive information! (Note: any combination of numbers will work when you are asked to provide the multi-factor authentication code.)

Pick one of these hypotheses that you would like to move forward with and design a product or feature that addresses this hypothesis. What are the primary use cases that you're solving? What does the feature do and how does it work?

Please use our [style guide](https://www.figma.com/file/i6U64YdCWEbbT0J8jyFBq0/Style-Guide?node-id=2%3A3) when designing your proposal. We are customer-centric and are obsessed with details, so deliver your best possible work. We also value intellectual rigor, so feel free to create new components or add functionality not described above.

We run a very collaborative process, so feel free to get in touch with us to ask questions, get feedback, or anything else we can help with (really).
You can deliver the prototype through any platform that you are familiar with – Invision, Marvel, Figma, anything that works –, as long as the final product is in English. If you'd like to document your process, we'd love to see wireframes, research, interviews, everything. Honestly, go for it!
