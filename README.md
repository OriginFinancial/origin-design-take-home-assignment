# Origin Product Take-Home Assignment

## The Assignment
We want to see your best work. You will share a case study of the best project you did.

We are not solely interested in the final screenshots, so please include all the documentation you have so we can understand your process from start to finish.

We expect you to go in-depth on at least the following questions:

- What was the problem?
- What research did you conduct?
- How did you make decisions?
- Did you use a styleguide? If so, who created it?
- How did you solve that problem?
- How did you collaborate with teammates (PMs, engineers, stakeholders, designers)?
- How did you measure its success?
- What do you know now that you wish you knew when you started? How the project would change?

## Criteria
We are looking for intellectually rigorous, relentless resourceful, detail-obsessed, customer-centric, technically excellent, professional design leaders.

Given that you show those qualities in your case study, you can deliver it in any form you like, as long as you use English. Just go for it.
